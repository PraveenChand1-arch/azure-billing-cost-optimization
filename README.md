💰 Azure Cosmos DB Cost Optimization with Serverless Architecture
🚀 Introduction
The challenge is to optimize costs for a growing Azure Cosmos DB database in a serverless architecture.
The system stores billing records that are read-heavy, but data older than 3 months is rarely accessed.
Each record is ~300 KB, and the database has 2M+ records.
We aim for simplicity, zero downtime, and no changes to existing API contracts.

🧠 Proposed Solution: Tiered Data Storage with Azure Blob Storage
Implement a hot–cold tiered storage model:

🔥 Hot Tier (Cosmos DB): Recent records (< 3 months)

❄️ Cold Tier (Blob Storage): Older records moved to cost-efficient blob storage

This reduces Cosmos DB RU & storage costs, while ensuring all data remains available within seconds.

🏗️ High-Level Architecture
🧩 Azure Cosmos DB: Stores recent records (last 90 days)

🗄️ Azure Blob Storage: Archives older records in a Cool/Archive tier

🔄 Azure Function (Archiver): Moves old records daily

🧪 Unified API Function: Reads from Cosmos DB first, then Blob Storage if not found

def get_billing_record(record_id):
    try:

        return json.loads(blob)
⚙️ Cost Optimization Strategy
🧱 Resource	🔀 Tier	💡 Reason
Cosmos DB	Serverless	Pay-per-request (RU/s)
Blob Storage	Cool/Archive	Up to 80% cheaper than Cosmos DB
Azure Functions	Consumption Plan	Scales to 0 = low cost
Indexing	Disabled for cold data	Save costs by skipping indexing

💥 Failure Points & Mitigations
⚠️ Problem	🛠️ Solution
Archival fails mid-record	Upload blob before deletion, use Durable Functions + retry
Data inconsistency	Mark records with isArchived: true before deletion
Slow Blob access	Use cache (Redis/local) for cold read optimization
Frequent cold read on same ID	Use CDN or Cosmos cache as a second-tier fallback

✅ Azure Cost Optimization Summary
📌 Category	📝 Details
Challenge	Cosmos DB costs rising due to 2M+ records, most >90 days old. APIs must not change.
Solution	Move old records to Blob Storage via automated functions. Keep hot data in Cosmos DB.
Benefit	Saves cost (storage + RU), seamless to user, no downtime, easy to scale + maintain.
